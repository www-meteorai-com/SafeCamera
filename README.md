# Meteor AI
Use the ai technology to build safety system

# Library Dependecies(库依赖)
* Opencv >= 2.4.0
* CUDA8.0
* Cudnn8.0

# Training(模型训练)
Using the YOLO project to training customize detect object, accord to the system to used,the training model have differen methods.
The steps just mainly on Windows and Linux platform
* Windows, need the libraries and IDE tools(Visual studio 2015, Opencv>=2.4.0,CUDA8.0,Cudnn8.0);
* Linux, Will be complement ();

## Training on Windows Steps
* Intall the opencv The reference link:
* Intall CUDA8.0,The software link(https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-80-ga2-download-archive)
* Install Cudnn8.0,The software link(https://sourceforge.net/projects/cuda-dnn/files/5.1/CUDA-8/cudnn-8.0-windows10-x64-v5.1.zip/download)
